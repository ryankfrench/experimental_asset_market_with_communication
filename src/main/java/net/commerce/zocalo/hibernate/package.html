{@link net.commerce.zocalo.hibernate.HibernateUtil} is a helper class for storing objects persistently
using <a href="http://hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>.<p>

The design allows a test version to be invoked at run time, so that hibernate calls in production code
will not invoke database actions in non-persistent tests.  If the test version is initialized with a
non-persistent SessionFactory, then the currentSession() call will invoke a MockSession rather than a
real one, and calls to session.save() or session.beginTransaction().commit() will not invoke db activity.<p>

{@link net.commerce.zocalo.hibernate.HibernateUtil#addClasses(Configuration)} should have a line added for each new
persistent class that is created.  Test-only classes should be described in HibernateTestUtil instead.
