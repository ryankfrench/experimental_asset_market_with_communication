These classes provide support for {@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.User} objects.
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.Warnable}
is the base class for users that report warnings to the user.  This allows
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.NonUser} (users who haven't logged in yet) to accept warning
messages.<p>
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.NonUser} are used before logging in, so there's a place to
store warnings.  {@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.UnconfirmedUser UnconfirmedUsers} represent
users who haven't authenticated yet.
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.User} represents users in experiments.
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.SecureUser} will be used for logged-in users of persistent
markets.  Security will be provided by the {@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.PasswordUtil},
which can generate new random tokens (encoded into readable form using
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.Base64}, a stripped-down public domain
utility), and {@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.Registry} will record user's tokens.
