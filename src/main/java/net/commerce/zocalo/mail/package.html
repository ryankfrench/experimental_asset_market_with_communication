Support for sending mail to the user.  Not currently in use.  The {@link
net.commerce.zocalo.mail.MailUtil} class was developed so installers wouldn't have to
separately download a copy of Sun's JavaMail package, which is free to use, but not open
source.  The license requires that each installation separately agree to the license
terms.  This alternative will only work on linux-based systems with /usr/bin/mailx available.
