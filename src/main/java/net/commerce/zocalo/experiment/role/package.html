This package contains the classes that manage roles for experiments.  The experimental subjects are
represented by the interface {@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.ExperimentSubject},
the abstract class {@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.AbstractSubject},
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.Judge} (which represents judges, who do not trade),
and {@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.TradingSubject}, the base class for
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.Manipulator} and
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.Trader}.<p>

The different roles that subjects may take on are represented by subclasses of
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.Role}.  Each knows what information to read from the
configuration file.  Current roles include
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.JudgeRole}, {@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.ManipulatorRole}, and
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.TraderRole}.  Multiple Trader roles are allowed in an experiment.
If Manipulators are present, there must also be Judges.
