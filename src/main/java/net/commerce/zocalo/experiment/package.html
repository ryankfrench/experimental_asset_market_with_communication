This package contains the classes that configure Zocalo to support experiments.
The experimental subjects are represented by the interface
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.ExperimentSubject},
the abstract class {@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.AbstractSubject},
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.Judge} (which represents judges, who do not trade),
and {@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.TradingSubject}, the base class for
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.Manipulator} and
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.role.Trader}.<p>

{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.Session} supports experimental sessions
configured by reading a property file.   {@link net.commerce.zocalo.service.PropertyHelper}
has support for reading property files, and
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.service.PropertyKeywords} defines tokens found in those files.
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.SessionSingleton} applies the
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SingletonPattern">Singleton pattern</a> to Sessions,
ensuring there is only one session object at a time.<p>
