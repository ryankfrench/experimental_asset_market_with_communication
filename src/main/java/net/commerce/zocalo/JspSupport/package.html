Support for generating web pages using JSP (Java Server Pages).  These classes support
both the lab experiment configuration and the prediction markets.  The hierarchy
organizes these classes according to the user's representation.
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.ReloadablePage} is the abstract base class for all the
classes that support html page generation.  Its only concrete subclass is
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.experiment.config.ConfigEditor}, which has no user model currently.
Abstract subclasses {@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.NamedUserPage} and
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.UserPage} support pages whose users are represented respectively
by their name or a {@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.SecureUser} object.  NamedUserPage has two abstract
subclasses, {@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.ExperimentPage} which
supports the jsp pages for experiments, and {@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.LoginScreen}, which
supports the screens that allow users to create an account
({@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.AccountCreationScreen}) or login
({@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.WelcomeScreen}).  (They need a user model in order
to display error messages during the process.)  {@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.TradeSupport} is
used by both ClaimPurchase and TraderScreen, and some methods useful for trading.<p>

{@link net.commerce.zocalo.service.ServerUtil} is the parent of classes that read config files,
while {@link net.commerce.zocalo.service.ServletUtil} provides support for classes that configure
<a href="http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/">jetty</a> servers to handle servlets, etc.<p>

The JSP screens for experiments
include {@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.ExperimenterScreen} (Experimenter's control console),
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.TraderScreen} (traders and manipulators), and
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.JudgeScreen} (judges).<p>

The Prediction Markets are supported by {@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.AccountDisplay}
(account status and holdings), {@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.MarketDisplay} (access to
active and closed markets), {@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.ClaimPurchase} (trading in
a market), {@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.MarketCreation} (creating new Markets), and
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.TradeHistory} (reviewing past trades).
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.service.AllMarkets} is the main() entry point for the prediction
markets, and provides access to the database and configuration info.<p>

Two Interfaces are here to support testing.
