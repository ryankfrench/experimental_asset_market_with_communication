These classes implement the market and process orders.  {@link net.commerce.zocalo.market.Market}
accepts orders entered by a {@link net.commerce.zocalo.user.User} and processes them, either
against other orders stored in a
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.market.Book}, or against the {@link net.commerce.zocalo.market.MarketMaker}.
Separate subclasses represent {@link net.commerce.zocalo.market.BinaryMarket BinaryMarkets} and
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.market.MultiMarket MultiMarkets}.  In parallel, the MarketMakers are
subdivided into {@link net.commerce.zocalo.market.BinaryMarketMaker BinaryMarketMaker} and
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.market.MultiMarketMaker}.
