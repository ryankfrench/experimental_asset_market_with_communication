These classes describe the claims being traded in the market.  {@link
net.commerce.zocalo.claim.Claim Claims} represent the questions being
asked.  {@link net.commerce.zocalo.claim.Position Positions} represent
possible outcomes of a claim.  {@link
net.commerce.zocalo.claim.BinaryClaim} represents claims with two
positions.  (In the experiment configuration, unary claims are
also represented by BinaryClaim; the difference is that traders aren't
allowed to hold negative coupons (and so some traders must start with
positive coupons.)  {@link net.commerce.zocalo.claim.MultiClaim}
represents claims with more than two positions.
