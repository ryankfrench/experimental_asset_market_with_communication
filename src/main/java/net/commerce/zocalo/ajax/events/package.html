This package describes significant events that will be logged via <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j">Log4J</a>
and <a href="http://cometd.org/">cometd</a> (an AJAX technology). The events are used to add information to the log,
to store records in the database, to update the strip chart showing bidding activity to experimental subjects, and
to notify the UI of significant events.  Log4J provides a general framework for connecting together reports of events
that can be output in a variety of formats and piped dynamically without changing the call site.<p>

All the event objects here descend from: {@link net.commerce.zocalo.ajax.events.Action Actions}.  They
represent particular events, which are published using Log4J and cometd.  <p>

Action objects describe trades and other changes in prices including new bids
({@link net.commerce.zocalo.ajax.events.Bid} and {@link net.commerce.zocalo.ajax.events.Ask}), retracted bids
({@link net.commerce.zocalo.ajax.events.OrderRemoval} and {@link net.commerce.zocalo.ajax.events.SelfDealing}), changes in the
best bid and ask ({@link net.commerce.zocalo.ajax.events.BestBid}, and
{@link net.commerce.zocalo.ajax.events.BestAsk}), and completed trades ({@link net.commerce.zocalo.ajax.events.Trade}).
There are also Actions representing {@link net.commerce.zocalo.ajax.events.Transition} actions affecting experiments.<p>

{@link net.commerce.zocalo.ajax.events Event}) objects are created when something significant happens in the server.<p>

Events are instances of subclasses of {@link net.commerce.zocalo.ajax.events.Action}, which extends {@link org.apache.log4j.spi.LoggingEvent}.
This makes it possible for them to be handed directly to a logger which causes them to be passed as an argument to the AppenderSkeleton's
{@link org.apache.log4j.AppenderSkeleton#append(org.apache.log4j.spi.LoggingEvent) append(LoggingEvent)}. method.<p>
