Display trading history to the user.  {@link net.commerce.zocalo.JspSupport.TradeHistory}
currently displays all transactions, and will eventually provide sorting and filtering
choices.  {@link net.commerce.zocalo.history.CostAccounter} calculates the costs of
bought and sold shares, and gains or losses.

The other classes here are a start on a new framework for recording trade history.<p>
